TEXT Embeddings
chroma_utils - collection of utility functions for working with Chroma
compare_methods - to show that search by vector and by string work the same
compare_texts - find similar passages between two novels
cosine_histogram - plot similarity for all pairs of passages across two novels
create_chroma - create a Chroma database using LangChain or native
parse_book - break a novel into chapters for use as metadata
query_data - run similarity search and pass results to Chat for comment
single_query - run one query different ways and pass to Chat for comment
double_query - run same query against both novels and pass to Chat for comment
data_checker - performs a variety of stats operations on a single collection
clustering - attempts to find (and visualize) similar clusters from the text
late_chunking - create database using latest chunking technique

WORD Embeddings
glove - experiment with Glove embedding
spacy_demo - experiment with Spacy embedding
sqlite_utlity - access Chroma's underlying SQL database
wikipedia - experiment with yet another embedding
word2vec - use word2vec and gensim to beat Semantle
